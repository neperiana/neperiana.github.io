Hi, my name is Camila and this is my personal data blog repo. Can be seen live in [neperiana.github.io](https://neperiana.github.io)!

### I like data

I like data, big data, small data, open data... you get the point. I usually write about my adventures analysing open datasets, participating in kaggle competitions or exploring new technologies. Sometimes I also do a bit of web development.

Also, python > R.

### About this blog

This is a Jekyll based blog hosted on github. In particular, this blog is built using [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/). (Thanks *barryclark*!) Tweaks and design are my own.

### Data + Catastrophe = Datastrophe

Catastrophe = an event causing great and usually sudden damage or suffering; a disaster.

Data is just a tool that can be used for good or bad. The name of this blog forces me to remember that datastrophes do happen and that with *big data comes big resposability*. Let's do good with data.
